        <p class="about-txt">[0:31 pm, 16/02/2023] +880 1795-188435: We are team NITER Neophytes, a group of ambitious and hardworking cybersecurity students who have competed in various contests and are committed to make a difference in our country and university.

            [0:32 pm, 16/02/2023] +880 1795-188435: National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER) is the first education institute running as a Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) organization under the Ministry of Textiles & Jute, GoB. It is located in its own campus at Nayarhat, Savar, Dhaka adjacent to the Dhaka-Aricha highway and enjoys excellent communication facilities connecting among important cities of the country. The total campus area of NITER is 13.06 Acres with adequate built up space in its academic, administrative, hostels, Canteen and other buildings.
            
            As per the decision of the Ministry of Textiles & Jute, NITER has been running under the management of ‘Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA)’ since September 2008. An operational agreement was signed between ‘Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA)’ and ‘Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC)’ under the Ministry of Textiles & Jute. After signing the agreement, BTMA actively took the responsibilities of NITER on May, 2009. That time it was known as ‘National Institute of Textile Training Research and Design (NITTRAD)’.
            
            BTMA expanded the academic span of the institute and started B. Sc. in Textile Engineering course under the Faculty of Engineering & Technology of the University of Dhaka. From 2010-2011 session, B. Sc. in Textile Engineering course was started. Considering the nature and future prospect of this institute, the University of Dhaka requested the Ministry of Textiles & Jute to change the name of NITTRAD. Accordingly the Ministry renamed NITTRAD as ‘National Institute of Textile Engineering and Research (NITER)’ from January 2013.
            
            Apart from Textile Engineering course, NITER is now offering four other important engineering courses namely B. Sc. in Industrial & Production Engineering (IPE) and Fashion Design & Apparel Engineering (FDAE), Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Electrical & Electronics Engineering (EEE) to meet the present demand skilled manpower as well as the automation of our Textile and allied sector. Furthermore NITER has started M.Sc. in Textile Engineering course under the Faculty of Engineering & Technology and MBA in Textile & Apparel Value Chain under the faculty of Business Studies of the University of Dhaka. Near about 2500 students are studying in these courses and the numbers are increasing every year.
            
            NITER is being operated by a ‘Governing Body’ consists of the members from BTMA, Ministry of Textiles & Jute, BTMC, University of Dhaka and from the institute as well. Mohammad Ali Khokon, renowned industrialist and the President of BTMA is the Chairman of the Governing Body</p>
